# DS3000-Covid-Project
Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arslanali4343/covid19-data-from-world

DS3000-Covid-Project uses a dataset with COVID information sorted by country such as weekly icu admissions per million, life expectancy in that country, and the number of people fully vaccinated per hundred. With a group of 3 other students, we cleaned and performed EDA on this dataset with the end goal of predicting the total number of deaths per million. We found that the best model was a Random Forest model that achieved a mean squared error of .13. When considering our target variable ranged from about 0 to 10, we were confident we had found an appropriate model. Completed with three other students as the final project for DS3000.
