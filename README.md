# DS3000-Covid-Project
Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arslanali4343/covid19-data-from-world

DS3000-Covid-Project uses a dataset with COVID information sorted by country such as weekly icu admissions per million, life expectancy in that country, and the number of people fully vaccinated per hundred. With a group of 3 other students, we cleaned and performed EDA on this dataset with the end goal of predicting the total number of deaths per million. We found that the best model was a Random Forest model that achieved a mean squared error of .13. When considering our target variable ranged from about 0 to 10, we were confident we had found an appropriate model. Completed with three other students as the final project for DS3000.

To expand upon this project, I utilized Tableau to create charts and graphs to show the correlation between different variables. This included bar charts, heat maps, line charts, and tree maps and culminated in a Tableau dashboard displaying some of the charts and graphs graphs. Further, I utilized a subsection of the original data to perform data cleaning steps in SQL. This included checking for duplicates, dealing with incorrect values, removing rows and columns, and dealing with null values. SQL techniques in this included creating a copy of a table, window functions, aggregations, date manipulation, changing column datatypes, updating values, dropping columns, CTEs, inserting values, and deleting rows.
